///****WRITE THIS FILE SECOND per instructons**
//HINT: Write Letter.js first and test it on its own before moving on, then do the same thing with Word.js
//HINT: If you name your letter's display function toString, JavaScript will call that function automatically 
    //whenever casting that object to a string (check out this example: https://jsbin.com/facawetume/edit?js,console)



//Word.js: Contains a constructor, Word that depends on the Letter constructor. 
    //This is used to create an object representing the current word the user is attempting to guess. 
    //That means the constructor should define:

//An array of new Letter objects representing the letters of the underlying word

//A function that returns a string representing the word. This should call the function on each letter object 
    //(the first function defined in Letter.js) that displays the character or an underscore and concatenate those together.

//A function that takes a character as an argument and calls the guess function on each letter object (the second function defined in Letter.js)
//Should require Letter.js file

var Letter = ("./Letter.js");
